# php-keypad-name-search
A simple PHP + HTML keypad interface that mimics the classic mobile T9 input system. Users can enter numeric sequences, and the script matches them against a predefined list of names using keypad character mappings (2 → abc, 3 → def, etc.). Includes reset, backspace, and search functionality.
